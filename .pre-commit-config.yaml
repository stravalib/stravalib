# pre-commit is a tool that you run locally
# to perform a predefined set of tasks manually and/or
# automatically before git commits are made.
# Here we are using pre-commit with the precommit.ci bot to implement
# code fixes automagically in pr's. You will still want to install pre-commit
# to run locally
# Config reference: https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-configyaml---top-level
# To run on a pr, add a comment with the text "pre-commit.ci run"
# Common tasks
#
# - Run on all files:   pre-commit run --all-files
# - Register git hooks: pre-commit install --install-hooks
