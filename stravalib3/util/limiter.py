Rate limiter classes.

These are basically callables that when called register that a request was
issued.  Depending on how they are configured that may cause a pause or exception
if a rate limit has been exceeded.  Obviously it is up to the calling code to ensure
that these callables are invoked with every (successful?) call to the backend
API.  (There is probably a better way to hook these into the requests library
directly ... TBD.)

From the Strava docs:
  Strava API usage is limited on a per-application basis using a short term,
  15 minute, limit and a long term, daily, limit. The default rate limit allows
  600 requests every 15 minutes, with up to 30,000 requests per day.

  This limit allows applications to make 40 requests per minute for about
  half the day.
