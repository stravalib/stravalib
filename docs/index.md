## About the stravalib Python package

**stravalib** is a Python library for interacting with
[version 3](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/) of the
[Strava](https://www.strava.com) API. Our goal is to expose the entire user-facing
Strava V3 API.

The **stravalib** Python package provides easy-to-use tools for accessing and
downloading Strava data from the Strava V3 web service. Stravalib provides a
`Client` class that supports:

* Authenticating with stravalib
* Accessing and downloading strava activity, club and profile data
* Making changes to account activities

It also provides support for working with date/time/temporal attributes
and quantities through the [Python Pint library](https://pypi.org/project/Pint/).

## Why use stravalib?

There are numerous reasons to use stravalib in your workflows:

* Stravalib returns your data in structured Python dictionaries with associated data types that make it easier to work with the data in Python.
* Relationships can be traversed on model objects to pull in related content "seamlessly".
* dates, times and durations are imported as Python objects making it easier to convert and work with this data.
* Stravalib provides built-in support for rate-limiting
*  and more intelligent error handling.
