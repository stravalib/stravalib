Usage Overview
**************

The :class:`stravalib.client.Client` class exposes methods that loosely correspond
with the REST methods exposed by the Strava API.

Retrieving Single Entities
==========================

The simplest case are the client methods that return single entities. The entity object
types are instances of :mod:`stravalib.model` classes. For example::

   client = Client(access_token=JOHNS_ACCESS_TOKEN)
   athlete = client.get_athlete() # Get John's full athlete record
   print("Hello, {}. I know your email is {}".format(athlete.firstname, athlete.email))
   # "Hello, John.  I know your email is john@example.com"

Entity Resource States
----------------------

Entities in Strava's API exist at different detail levels, denoted by the numeric
`resource_state` attribute (1=metadata, 2=summary, 3=detailed).  In general, detail level
3 ("detailed") is only available to the user that is authenticated.  Detail level 2 ("summary")
information is available to others.  For example::

   other_athlete = client.get_athlete(123) # Some other Athlete ID
   other_athlete.firstname  # This is accessible
   # But this is not:
   # other_athlete.email


Retrieving Entity Result Sets
=============================

A number of Strava API endpoints return paged results.  The stravalib library abstracts over
the paging to provide an iterator that will iterate over the entire resultset, fetching 200-page
result sets under the hood.

This capability is provided by the :class:`stravalib.client.BatchedResultsIterator` class.  If
you only wish to fetch a few objects, you can specify a limit in the method call or set the limit
on the resulting iterator.::

   activities = client.get_activities(limit=10)
   assert len(list(activities)) == 10

   # or:
   activities = client.get_activities()
   activities.limit = 10
   assert len(list(activities)) == 10

Note that setting the limit on the iterator is the only option when you are using the collection
attributes on entities.::

   activity = client.get_activity(activity_id)
   comments = activity.comments
   comments.limit = 1
   assert len(list(comments)) == 1


Attribute Types and Units
=========================

Many of the attributes in the Strava API are either temporal (or interval) types or quantities
that have implicit units associated with them. In both cases these are represented using
richer python types than the simple string or numeric values that Strava REST API returns.

Date/Time Types
---------------

The date+time responses are encoded as python native :class:`datetime.datetime` objects.::

   a = client.get_activity(96089609)
   print(a.start_date)
   # 2013-11-17 16:00:00+00:00

Date values which have no time component are encoded as python native :class:`datetime.date` objects.::

   me = client.get_athlete()
   print(me.dateofbirth)
   # 2010-12-26

Interval/duration values are represented using :class:`datetime.timedelta` objects, which allows
them to be added to datetime objects, etc.::

   a = client.get_activity(96089609)
   print(a.elapsed_time)
   # 10:45:00
   print(a.elapsed_time.seconds)
   # 38700


Quantities and Units
--------------------

Typically the units for quantity attributes returned by the Strava REST API are not
what people would actually want to see (e.g. meters-per-second instead of
kilometers-per-hour or miles-per-hour).

To facilitate working with these quantities, stravalib makes use of the
`pint library <https://pypi.org/project/Pint/>`_.  You can simply cast the values string
to see a representation that includes the units::

   activity = client.get_activity(96089609)
   print(activity.distance)
   # 22530.80 m

Hmmm, meters.  Well, here in the US we like to see miles.  While you can certainly do this using the units
library directly, stravalib provides a preconfigured set of common units to simplify matters.::

   from stravalib import unithelper

   activity = client.get_activity(96089609)
   print(unithelper.miles(activity.distance))
   # 14.00 mi

Of course, if you want to do something besides display those values, you'll likely
want a number.  You can directly access the 'magnitude' attribute of the :class:`pint.Quantity` instance,
or just cast to a numeric type (e.g. float).::

   activity = client.get_activity(96089609)
   print(float(activity.distance))
   # 22530.8
   print(float(unithelper.miles(activity.distance)))
   # 13.9999900581


Rate Limits
===========

Strava imposes rate limits on the usage of its API. This means that the number of
requests sent to Strava have an upper limit per 15 minutes and per day. These limits
are not fixed but depend on the "size" of the client app. Strava _may_ choose to
adjust rate limits for apps as they grow. [Learn more about rate limits here.](https://developers.strava.com/docs/rate-limits/)
You can see the limits set for your app at [your account's settings.](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)

When initializing a `stravalib.Client` instance, the default rate limiter allows requests until
the short - or daily limits are reached. Once limits are reached. the client object will wait until the end of
the 15-minute or day period.

In case you want to configure the limiter to throttle requests (i.e., making sure
the time between requests for the remaining period is evenly spread), you can
initialize the client object as::

   from stravalib.util.limiter import DefaultRateLimiter
    client = stravalib.Client(
        my_access_token, rate_limiter=DefaultRateLimiter(priority='medium')
    )


The ``low`` priority complies with the daily limit. The ``medium`` priority ensures that requests are throttled to comply with the
15-minute limit.
